## What's a perfect file explorer

A perfect file explorer will change from person to person. For that reason, we aim to make it extremely flexible so that you can transform it into anything you want as well as plugins to add more power.

## Status

It's in very early development. We're expecting that by February 2017, most of the base features will be functional. You can find here a list and status of the upcoming features we want for v1.0.0 [Project status for v1.0](https://github.com/desduvauchelle/file-explorer/projects/1)

The next stage will be to make the application more modular and customizable.

## Issues

If you have issues or questions with the application, feel free to reach out to us: [Reach out](https://github.com/desduvauchelle/file-explorer/issues)

## How to build the application on your computer

1. Make sure you have NodeJs installed on your computer
2. In terminal, navigate to the directory `cd your/folder`
3. Install dependencies `npm install`

That's it, it's ready. But here is how to do things:

- To package the application in your OS `npm run package`
- To package for all OS `npm run package-all` (Please note that you might run into some errors, see [Electron mutli platform build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) )
- To run in dev `npm run dev`
